### Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Reddit Comment Classification

**Team**
- Harmanpreet Singh (20164950)
- Alexander Peplowski (20148127)  

We examine multiple classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes with smoothing, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and sequence models. Investigated feature extraction approaches such as term-frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and self-trained word2vec embeddings.

Training and test data must be stored at:
- **Train Data**: `data/data_train.pkl`
- **Test Data**: `data/data_test.pkl`

Labelled test data is output as: `submission.csv`
